# Monoclonal antibodies 

## Antibodies : an overview

- Y structure : the tips are highly specific to "epitopes"
    = antigenic determinants ; remainder => effector functions
    enable the molecule to interact with other immune cells
    or serum proteins

- come from B cells (that die in a few days after isolation)

- polyclonal antibodies : able to detect multiple type of epitopes
    => can recognize an antigen from different orientations
    simple & cheap to produce in the short term
    pb of batch to batch variation

- monoclonal antibodies : recognize only one epitope
    => standardized & secure immnunoassay systems
    produced from B cells hybridomas

## The production of monoclonal antibodies

Monoclonal antibody :
> antibody of single specificity, generated from the immortalization
> of a plasma B cell in vitro
