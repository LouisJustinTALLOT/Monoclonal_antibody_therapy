First of all, let us examine what an antibody is, and see how this
type of molecules possesses remarkable properties that make it suitable
for therapeutic use.

An \emph{antibody} (also known as \emph{immunoglobulin}) is a protein produced by the 
body's immune system that binds to a specific antigen. It is composed of four
polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains 
and two identical light chains \cite{davies_antibody_1993}. 

The way this chains are self-assembled gives the protein a Y-shaped structure,
as seen on figure \ref{fig:immunoglobulin_3D_model}. 
Each of them features a terminal high-variability domain, which when spatially grouped 
together form a binding site that can be adapted to a wide variety of antigens.

        The variation between immunoglobulins in the low-variability domain
        creates multiple antibody classes, also known as \emph{isotypes} :
        IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM (\textit{cf.} figure \ref{fig:antibody_classes}). 
        They all have different functions, but act
        following the same general principles that will be discussed later in this paper.

        The most important one are :
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
            \item IgG, which represents $75\%$ of serum antibodies
            in humans. It is involved in the immunity transmitted by a mother
            to her newborn, protecting the child for the first six months of life
            before it can acquire its own immune memory.
            \item IgM, which auto-assembles to form a pentamer, is the largest
            antibody and one of the first to respond to an antigen intrusion.
        \end{itemize}
