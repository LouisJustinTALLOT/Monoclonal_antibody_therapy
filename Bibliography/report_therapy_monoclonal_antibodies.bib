	abstract = {Monoclonal antibody therapeutics have been approved for over 30 targets and diseases, most commonly cancer. Antibodies have become the new backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, which previously relied on small molecules. Compared with small molecules, monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) have exquisite target selectivity and hence less toxicity as a result of binding other targets. The clinical value of both {mAbs} and ligand traps has been proven. New applications of {mAbs} are being tested and {mAbs} have now been designed to target two (bi-specific, eg {TNF}-α and {IL}-17) or more targets simultaneously, augmenting their therapeutic potential. Because of space limitations and the wide ranging scope of this review there are regrettably, but inevitably, omissions and missing citations. We have chosen to highlight the first successes in inflammatory diseases and cancer, but a broader overview of approved {mAbs} and related molecules can be found in Table 1.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for many molecular immunology investigations. In particular, when used in combination with techniques such as epitope mapping and molecular modelling, monoclonal antibodies enable the antigenic profiling and visualisation of macromolecular surfaces. In addition, monoclonal antibodies have become key components in a vast array of clinical laboratory diagnostic tests. Their wide application in detecting and identifying serum analytes, cell markers, and pathogenic agents has largely arisen through the exquisite specificity of these unique reagents. Furthermore, the continuous culture of hybridoma cells that produce these antibodies offers the potential of an unlimited supply of reagent. In essence, when compared with the rather limited supply of polyclonal antibody reagents, the feature of a continuous supply enables the standardisation of both the reagent and the assay technique. Clearly, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of generation, cost, and overall applications. Ultimately, monoclonal antibodies are only produced when necessary because their production is time consuming and frustrating, although greatly rewarding (at least most of the time!). This is especially apparent when a monoclonal antibody can be applied successfully in a routine pathology laboratory or can aid in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. In this article, the generation and application of monoclonal antibodies are demystified to enable greater understanding and hopefully formulate novel ideas for clinicians and scientists alike.},

	doi = {10.1038/leu.2016.226},
	abstract = {A key feature of the adaptive immune system is the generation of memory B and T cells and long-lived plasma cells, providing protective immunity against recurring infectious agents. Memory B cells are generated in germinal center ({GC}) reactions in the course of T cell-dependent immune responses and are distinguished from naive B cells by an increased lifespan, faster and stronger response to stimulation and expression of somatically mutated and affinity matured immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Approximately 40\% of human B cells in adults are memory B cells, and several subsets were identified. Besides {IgG}+ and {IgA}+ memory B cells, ∼50\% of peripheral blood memory B cells express {IgM} with or without {IgD}. Further smaller subpopulations have additionally been described. These various subsets share typical memory B cell features, but likely also fulfill distinct functions. {IgM} memory B cells appear to have the propensity for refined adaptation upon restimulation in additional {GC} reactions, whereas reactivated {IgG} B cells rather differentiate directly into plasma cells. The human memory B-cell pool is characterized by (sometimes amazingly large) clonal expansions, often showing extensive intraclonal {IgV} gene diversity. Moreover, memory B-cell clones are frequently composed of members of various subsets, showing that from a single {GC} B-cell clone a variety of memory B cells with distinct functions is generated. Thus, the human memory B-cell compartment is highly diverse and flexible. Several B-cell malignancies display features suggesting a derivation from memory B cells. This includes a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and marginal zone lymphomas. The exposure of memory B cells to oncogenic events during their generation in the {GC}, the longevity of these B cells and the ease to activate them may be key determinants for their malignant transformation.},

Monoclonal antibody therapy harnesses host defense mechanisms through activation of the antibody dependent cytotoxic pathway and complement mediated cytotoxicity. However, these two processes alone do not explain the therapeutic efficacy of antibody therapy; they also act by apoptotic signaling and growth inhibitory pathways. Conjugation of monoclonal antibody therapy, with radionuclides or toxins, offers more therapeutic approaches. Initial data demonstrates efficacy of single agent use, although combination therapy appears potentially more beneficial. Monoclonal antibody therapy is having a significant impact on many disease processes, particularly malignancies of solid and hematological origin.

No difference was observed between the values obtained for Lesch-Nyhan and control lymphocytes, when {PHA}-stimulated without added azaserine. The percentage reduction in the incorporation of precursors into nucleoprotein and protein after {PHA} stimulation in the presence of azaserine was more obvious in the lymphocytes of the patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome than in the controls after the shorter incubation periods at the lower rates of synthesis. Blocking the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, in control {PHA} stimulated lymphocytes, inhibited transformation, whereas loss of the purine salvage enzyme {HGPRT} did not have this effect. These results are compatible with the view that the brain and bone-marrow damage that occur in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are the result of lack of {HGPRT} in tissues with little de novo purine biosynthetic capability. Other tissues with both pruine biosynthetic and salvage pathways are less vulnerable to the enzyme defect. Some possible mechanisms by which {HGPRT} deficiency could act are discussed. We suggest that inability to increase the supply of guanylic acid ({GMP}) in response to a mitotic stimulus may mediate the effect of {HGPRT} deficiency.},

This sensitivity permitted the primary screening of cell specific antibodies from hybridoma supernatants. The same detection limit was obtained in flow cytometric analysis.

When analysing different cell lines with selected antibodies the cell {ELISA} was found to be as sensitive and specific as the fluorescence assay.

	abstract = {Antiviral activities of antibodies may either be dependent only on interactions between the antibody and cognate antigen, as in binding and neutralization of an infectious virion, or instead may require interactions between antibody–antigen immune complexes and immunoproteins or Fc receptor expressing immune effector cells. These Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions provide a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune systems by combining the potent antiviral activity of innate effector cells with the diversity and specificity of the adaptive humoral response. The Fc receptor-dependent function of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis ({ADCP}) provides mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells, as well as for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by facilitating antigen presentation, or by stimulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. In this review, we discuss the properties of Fc receptors, antibodies, and effector cells that influence {ADCP}. We also provide and interpret evidence from studies that support a potential role for {ADCP} in either inhibiting or enhancing viral infection. Finally, we describe current approaches used to measure antiviral {ADCP} and discuss considerations for the translation of studies performed in animal models. We propose that additional investigation into the role of {ADCP} in protective viral responses, the specific virus epitopes targeted by {ADCP} antibodies, and the types of phagocytes and Fc receptors involved in {ADCP} at sites of virus infection will provide insight into strategies to successfully leverage this important immune response for improved antiviral immunity through rational vaccine design.},

	abstract = {Receptors for the Fc portion of Ig (Fc receptors, {FcR}) are found on all cell types of the immune system. Three types of {FcR} react with {IgG}: {FcγRI} is a high-affinity receptor binding {IgG} monomers whereas {FcγRII} and {FcγRIII} are low-affinity receptors binding {IgG} immune complexes; the three types of {FcγR} are members of the Ig superfamily. Two {FcR} react with {IgE}: Fc∊{RI} is a multichain receptor binding {IgE} with high affinity; it is composed of an {IgE}-binding α chain, homologous to {FcγRIII}, and of γ and β chains that are necessary for receptor expression and signal transduction. The low-affinity Fc∊{RII} is the only {FcR} described so far that is not a member of the Ig superfamily but resembles animal lectins; it is composed of a transmembrane chain with an intracytoplasmic {NH}2 terminus. {FcαR} has homology with {FcγR} and is a member of the Ig superfamily. Receptors for {IgM} and {IgD} are not characterized yet. Finally, Ig transport is made by {FcR}-like molecules such as the poly-Ig receptor or an {MHC}-like receptor found on neonatal intestine. A remarkable property of most {FcR} is the fact that they are released in cell supernatants and circulate in biological fluids as immunoglobulin binding factors ({IBF}) generated either by cleavage at the cell membrane or by splicing of {FcR} transmembrane exon. Immunoglobulin binding factors may interfere with Ig-mediated functions and have direct immunoregulatory activities. Involvement of {FcR} or {IBF} has been postulated in several diseases, and monoclonal antibodies to {FcR} are beginning to be used in therapeutics, particularly to target cytotoxic effector lymphocytes and monocytes to tumor cells.—Fridman, W.

Phagocytosis is found in many types of cells and it is, in consequence an essential process for tissue homeostasis. However, only specialized cells termed professional phagocytes accomplish phagocytosis with high efficiency. Macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts are among these dedicated cells. These professional phagocytes express several phagocytic receptors that activate signaling pathways resulting in phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis involves several phases: i) detection of the particle to be ingested, ii) activation of the internalization process, iii) formation of a specialized vacuole called phagosome, and iv) maturation of the phagosome to transform it into a phagolysosome. In this review, we present a general view of our current understanding on cells, phagocytic receptors and phases involved in phagocytosis.},

Increasing evidence suggests that tumor microenvironment regulate the phenotype and function of {NK} cells. In this review, we discussed the {NK} cell phenotypes and its effector function and impact of the tumor microenvironment on effector and cytolytic function of {NK} cells.

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) can reduce the risk of hospitalization when administered early during {COVID}-19 disease. However, the emergence of variants of concern has negatively impacted the therapeutic use of some authorized {mAbs}. Using a high throughput B-cell screening pipeline, we isolated a highly potent {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain ({RBD})-specific antibody called {LY}-{CoV}1404 (also known as bebtelovimab). {LY}-{CoV}1404 potently neutralizes authentic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus, including the prototype, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2). In pseudovirus neutralization studies, {LY}-{CoV}1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, and B.1.1.529, and retains binding to spike proteins with a variety of underlying {RBD} mutations including K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y. Structural analysis demonstrates that {RBD} residues comprising the {LY}-{CoV}1404 epitope are highly conserved with the exception of N439 and N501. Notably, the binding and neutralizing activity of {LY}-{CoV}1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The breadth of reactivity to amino acid substitutions present among current {VOC} together with broad and potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that {LY}-{CoV}1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants causing {COVID}-19.
In Brief {LY}-{CoV}1404 is a potent {SARS}-{CoV}-2-binding antibody that neutralizes all known variants of concern and whose epitope is rarely mutated.

Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate or standard antirheumatic therapies, or as monotherapy, is effective in the treatment of adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Adalimumab is also effective in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis, improving both joint and skin manifestations of the disease as well as disability due to joint damage. In the Adalimumab Trial Evaluating Long-term Efficacy and Safety in Ankylosing Spondylitis ({ATLAS}), adalimumab significantly reduced the signs and symptoms of active ankylosing spondylitis and established a sustained clinical response in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy. Overall, across these indications, adalimumab demonstrated a rapid onset of action, sustained efficacy with long-term treatment, and was well-tolerated, with few patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.

	abstract = {{HER}2, a member of the Erythroblastosis Protein B/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ({ErbB}/{HER}) family of receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in 20{\textasciitilde}30\% of human breast cancers. Trastuzumab, a {HER}2-targeted therapeutic monoclonal antibody, was developed to interfere with the homodimerization of {HER}2 in {HER}2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, which attenuates {HER}2-mediated signaling. Trastuzumab binds to the domain {IV} of the {HER}2 extracellular domain and does not directly block the dimerization interface of {HER}2-{HER}2 molecules. The three-dimensional structures of the tyrosine kinase domains of {ErbB}/{HER} family receptors show asymmetrical packing of the two monomers with distinct conformations. One monomer functions as an activator, whereas the other acts as a receiver. Once activated, the receiver monomer phosphorylates the activator or other proteins. Interestingly, in our previous work, we found that the binding of trastuzumab induced phosphorylation of {HER}2 with the phosphorylation pattern of {HER}2 that is different from that mediated by epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2)-positive breast cancer. Binding of trastuzumab to {HER}2 promoted an allosteric effect of {HER}2, in both tyrosine kinase domain and ectodomain of {HER}2 although details of allosteric regulation were missing. In this study, we utilized molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations to model the allosteric consequences of trastuzumab binding to {HER}2 homodimers and heterodimers, along with the apo forms as controls. We focused on the conformational changes of {HER}2 in its monomeric and dimeric forms. The data indicated the apparent dual role of trastuzumab as an antagonist and an agonist. The molecular details of the simulation provide an atomic level description and molecular insight into the action of {HER}2-targeted antibody therapeutics.},

Upon binding to {HER}2, the conjugate is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and an active derivative of {DM}1 is subsequently released by proteolytic degradation of the antibody moiety within the lysosome. Initial clinical evaluation led to a phase {III} trial in advanced {HER}2-positive breast cancer patients who had relapsed after prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, which showed that T-{DM}1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine. In 2013, T-{DM}1 received {FDA} approval for the treatment of patients with {HER}2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, the first {ADC} to receive full approval based on a randomized study.},
