	abstract = {Monoclonal antibody therapeutics have been approved for over 30 targets and diseases, most commonly cancer. Antibodies have become the new backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, which previously relied on small molecules. Compared with small molecules, monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) have exquisite target selectivity and hence less toxicity as a result of binding other targets. The clinical value of both {mAbs} and ligand traps has been proven. New applications of {mAbs} are being tested and {mAbs} have now been designed to target two (bi-specific, eg {TNF}-α and {IL}-17) or more targets simultaneously, augmenting their therapeutic potential. Because of space limitations and the wide ranging scope of this review there are regrettably, but inevitably, omissions and missing citations. We have chosen to highlight the first successes in inflammatory diseases and cancer, but a broader overview of approved {mAbs} and related molecules can be found in Table 1.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for many molecular immunology investigations. In particular, when used in combination with techniques such as epitope mapping and molecular modelling, monoclonal antibodies enable the antigenic profiling and visualisation of macromolecular surfaces. In addition, monoclonal antibodies have become key components in a vast array of clinical laboratory diagnostic tests. Their wide application in detecting and identifying serum analytes, cell markers, and pathogenic agents has largely arisen through the exquisite specificity of these unique reagents. Furthermore, the continuous culture of hybridoma cells that produce these antibodies offers the potential of an unlimited supply of reagent. In essence, when compared with the rather limited supply of polyclonal antibody reagents, the feature of a continuous supply enables the standardisation of both the reagent and the assay technique. Clearly, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of generation, cost, and overall applications. Ultimately, monoclonal antibodies are only produced when necessary because their production is time consuming and frustrating, although greatly rewarding (at least most of the time!). This is especially apparent when a monoclonal antibody can be applied successfully in a routine pathology laboratory or can aid in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. In this article, the generation and application of monoclonal antibodies are demystified to enable greater understanding and hopefully formulate novel ideas for clinicians and scientists alike.},

	doi = {10.1038/leu.2016.226},
	abstract = {A key feature of the adaptive immune system is the generation of memory B and T cells and long-lived plasma cells, providing protective immunity against recurring infectious agents. Memory B cells are generated in germinal center ({GC}) reactions in the course of T cell-dependent immune responses and are distinguished from naive B cells by an increased lifespan, faster and stronger response to stimulation and expression of somatically mutated and affinity matured immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Approximately 40\% of human B cells in adults are memory B cells, and several subsets were identified. Besides {IgG}+ and {IgA}+ memory B cells, ∼50\% of peripheral blood memory B cells express {IgM} with or without {IgD}. Further smaller subpopulations have additionally been described. These various subsets share typical memory B cell features, but likely also fulfill distinct functions. {IgM} memory B cells appear to have the propensity for refined adaptation upon restimulation in additional {GC} reactions, whereas reactivated {IgG} B cells rather differentiate directly into plasma cells. The human memory B-cell pool is characterized by (sometimes amazingly large) clonal expansions, often showing extensive intraclonal {IgV} gene diversity. Moreover, memory B-cell clones are frequently composed of members of various subsets, showing that from a single {GC} B-cell clone a variety of memory B cells with distinct functions is generated. Thus, the human memory B-cell compartment is highly diverse and flexible. Several B-cell malignancies display features suggesting a derivation from memory B cells. This includes a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and marginal zone lymphomas. The exposure of memory B cells to oncogenic events during their generation in the {GC}, the longevity of these B cells and the ease to activate them may be key determinants for their malignant transformation.},

Monoclonal antibody therapy harnesses host defense mechanisms through activation of the antibody dependent cytotoxic pathway and complement mediated cytotoxicity. However, these two processes alone do not explain the therapeutic efficacy of antibody therapy; they also act by apoptotic signaling and growth inhibitory pathways. Conjugation of monoclonal antibody therapy, with radionuclides or toxins, offers more therapeutic approaches. Initial data demonstrates efficacy of single agent use, although combination therapy appears potentially more beneficial. Monoclonal antibody therapy is having a significant impact on many disease processes, particularly malignancies of solid and hematological origin.

No difference was observed between the values obtained for Lesch-Nyhan and control lymphocytes, when {PHA}-stimulated without added azaserine. The percentage reduction in the incorporation of precursors into nucleoprotein and protein after {PHA} stimulation in the presence of azaserine was more obvious in the lymphocytes of the patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome than in the controls after the shorter incubation periods at the lower rates of synthesis. Blocking the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, in control {PHA} stimulated lymphocytes, inhibited transformation, whereas loss of the purine salvage enzyme {HGPRT} did not have this effect. These results are compatible with the view that the brain and bone-marrow damage that occur in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are the result of lack of {HGPRT} in tissues with little de novo purine biosynthetic capability. Other tissues with both pruine biosynthetic and salvage pathways are less vulnerable to the enzyme defect. Some possible mechanisms by which {HGPRT} deficiency could act are discussed. We suggest that inability to increase the supply of guanylic acid ({GMP}) in response to a mitotic stimulus may mediate the effect of {HGPRT} deficiency.},

This sensitivity permitted the primary screening of cell specific antibodies from hybridoma supernatants. The same detection limit was obtained in flow cytometric analysis.

When analysing different cell lines with selected antibodies the cell {ELISA} was found to be as sensitive and specific as the fluorescence assay.

	abstract = {Antiviral activities of antibodies may either be dependent only on interactions between the antibody and cognate antigen, as in binding and neutralization of an infectious virion, or instead may require interactions between antibody–antigen immune complexes and immunoproteins or Fc receptor expressing immune effector cells. These Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions provide a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune systems by combining the potent antiviral activity of innate effector cells with the diversity and specificity of the adaptive humoral response. The Fc receptor-dependent function of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis ({ADCP}) provides mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells, as well as for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by facilitating antigen presentation, or by stimulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. In this review, we discuss the properties of Fc receptors, antibodies, and effector cells that influence {ADCP}. We also provide and interpret evidence from studies that support a potential role for {ADCP} in either inhibiting or enhancing viral infection. Finally, we describe current approaches used to measure antiviral {ADCP} and discuss considerations for the translation of studies performed in animal models. We propose that additional investigation into the role of {ADCP} in protective viral responses, the specific virus epitopes targeted by {ADCP} antibodies, and the types of phagocytes and Fc receptors involved in {ADCP} at sites of virus infection will provide insight into strategies to successfully leverage this important immune response for improved antiviral immunity through rational vaccine design.},

	abstract = {Receptors for the Fc portion of Ig (Fc receptors, {FcR}) are found on all cell types of the immune system. Three types of {FcR} react with {IgG}: {FcγRI} is a high-affinity receptor binding {IgG} monomers whereas {FcγRII} and {FcγRIII} are low-affinity receptors binding {IgG} immune complexes; the three types of {FcγR} are members of the Ig superfamily. Two {FcR} react with {IgE}: Fc∊{RI} is a multichain receptor binding {IgE} with high affinity; it is composed of an {IgE}-binding α chain, homologous to {FcγRIII}, and of γ and β chains that are necessary for receptor expression and signal transduction. The low-affinity Fc∊{RII} is the only {FcR} described so far that is not a member of the Ig superfamily but resembles animal lectins; it is composed of a transmembrane chain with an intracytoplasmic {NH}2 terminus. {FcαR} has homology with {FcγR} and is a member of the Ig superfamily. Receptors for {IgM} and {IgD} are not characterized yet. Finally, Ig transport is made by {FcR}-like molecules such as the poly-Ig receptor or an {MHC}-like receptor found on neonatal intestine. A remarkable property of most {FcR} is the fact that they are released in cell supernatants and circulate in biological fluids as immunoglobulin binding factors ({IBF}) generated either by cleavage at the cell membrane or by splicing of {FcR} transmembrane exon. Immunoglobulin binding factors may interfere with Ig-mediated functions and have direct immunoregulatory activities. Involvement of {FcR} or {IBF} has been postulated in several diseases, and monoclonal antibodies to {FcR} are beginning to be used in therapeutics, particularly to target cytotoxic effector lymphocytes and monocytes to tumor cells.—Fridman, W.

Phagocytosis is found in many types of cells and it is, in consequence an essential process for tissue homeostasis. However, only specialized cells termed professional phagocytes accomplish phagocytosis with high efficiency. Macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts are among these dedicated cells. These professional phagocytes express several phagocytic receptors that activate signaling pathways resulting in phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis involves several phases: i) detection of the particle to be ingested, ii) activation of the internalization process, iii) formation of a specialized vacuole called phagosome, and iv) maturation of the phagosome to transform it into a phagolysosome. In this review, we present a general view of our current understanding on cells, phagocytic receptors and phases involved in phagocytosis.},

Increasing evidence suggests that tumor microenvironment regulate the phenotype and function of {NK} cells. In this review, we discussed the {NK} cell phenotypes and its effector function and impact of the tumor microenvironment on effector and cytolytic function of {NK} cells.

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) can reduce the risk of hospitalization when administered early during {COVID}-19 disease. However, the emergence of variants of concern has negatively impacted the therapeutic use of some authorized {mAbs}. Using a high throughput B-cell screening pipeline, we isolated a highly potent {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain ({RBD})-specific antibody called {LY}-{CoV}1404 (also known as bebtelovimab). {LY}-{CoV}1404 potently neutralizes authentic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus, including the prototype, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2). In pseudovirus neutralization studies, {LY}-{CoV}1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, and B.1.1.529, and retains binding to spike proteins with a variety of underlying {RBD} mutations including K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y. Structural analysis demonstrates that {RBD} residues comprising the {LY}-{CoV}1404 epitope are highly conserved with the exception of N439 and N501. Notably, the binding and neutralizing activity of {LY}-{CoV}1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The breadth of reactivity to amino acid substitutions present among current {VOC} together with broad and potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that {LY}-{CoV}1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants causing {COVID}-19.
In Brief {LY}-{CoV}1404 is a potent {SARS}-{CoV}-2-binding antibody that neutralizes all known variants of concern and whose epitope is rarely mutated.

Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate or standard antirheumatic therapies, or as monotherapy, is effective in the treatment of adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Adalimumab is also effective in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis, improving both joint and skin manifestations of the disease as well as disability due to joint damage. In the Adalimumab Trial Evaluating Long-term Efficacy and Safety in Ankylosing Spondylitis ({ATLAS}), adalimumab significantly reduced the signs and symptoms of active ankylosing spondylitis and established a sustained clinical response in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy. Overall, across these indications, adalimumab demonstrated a rapid onset of action, sustained efficacy with long-term treatment, and was well-tolerated, with few patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.

	abstract = {{HER}2, a member of the Erythroblastosis Protein B/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ({ErbB}/{HER}) family of receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in 20{\textasciitilde}30\% of human breast cancers. Trastuzumab, a {HER}2-targeted therapeutic monoclonal antibody, was developed to interfere with the homodimerization of {HER}2 in {HER}2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, which attenuates {HER}2-mediated signaling. Trastuzumab binds to the domain {IV} of the {HER}2 extracellular domain and does not directly block the dimerization interface of {HER}2-{HER}2 molecules. The three-dimensional structures of the tyrosine kinase domains of {ErbB}/{HER} family receptors show asymmetrical packing of the two monomers with distinct conformations. One monomer functions as an activator, whereas the other acts as a receiver. Once activated, the receiver monomer phosphorylates the activator or other proteins. Interestingly, in our previous work, we found that the binding of trastuzumab induced phosphorylation of {HER}2 with the phosphorylation pattern of {HER}2 that is different from that mediated by epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2)-positive breast cancer. Binding of trastuzumab to {HER}2 promoted an allosteric effect of {HER}2, in both tyrosine kinase domain and ectodomain of {HER}2 although details of allosteric regulation were missing. In this study, we utilized molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations to model the allosteric consequences of trastuzumab binding to {HER}2 homodimers and heterodimers, along with the apo forms as controls. We focused on the conformational changes of {HER}2 in its monomeric and dimeric forms. The data indicated the apparent dual role of trastuzumab as an antagonist and an agonist. The molecular details of the simulation provide an atomic level description and molecular insight into the action of {HER}2-targeted antibody therapeutics.},

Upon binding to {HER}2, the conjugate is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and an active derivative of {DM}1 is subsequently released by proteolytic degradation of the antibody moiety within the lysosome. Initial clinical evaluation led to a phase {III} trial in advanced {HER}2-positive breast cancer patients who had relapsed after prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, which showed that T-{DM}1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine. In 2013, T-{DM}1 received {FDA} approval for the treatment of patients with {HER}2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, the first {ADC} to receive full approval based on a randomized study.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), the highly contagious viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), has had a catastrophic effect on the world’s demographics resulting in more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide, emerging as the most consequential global health crisis since the era of the influenza pandemic of 1918. After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, {SARS}-{CoV}-2  rapidly disseminated across the world in a short span of time, compelling the World Health Organization ({WHO}) to declare it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since being declared a global pandemic, {COVID}-19 has ravaged many countries worldwide and has overwhelmed many healthcare systems. The pandemic has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy. Even though substantial progress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and the management of {COVID}-19, limiting the continuing spread of this virus and its variants has become an issue of increasing concern, as {SARS}-{CoV}-2 continues to wreak havoc across the world, with many countries enduring a second or third wave of outbreaks of this viral illness attributed mainly due to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus.  Like other {RNA} viruses, {SARS}-{CoV}-2, while adapting to their new human hosts, is prone to genetic evolution with the development of mutations over time, resulting in mutant variants that may have different characteristics than its ancestral strains. Several variants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 have been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few are considered variants of concern ({VOCs}) by the {WHO}, given their impact on global public health. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the {WHO}, as of December 11, 2021, five {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {VOCs} have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic: Alpha (B.1.1.7): first variant of concern described in the United Kingdom ({UK}) in late December 2020. Beta (B.1.351): first reported in South Africa in December 2020. Gamma(P.1): first reported in Brazil in early January 2021. Delta (B.1.617.2): first reported in India in December 2020. Omicron (B.1.1.529): first reported in South Africa in November 2021. Despite the unprecedented speed of vaccine development against the prevention of {COVID}-19 and robust global mass vaccination efforts including vaccine boosters, the emergence of these new {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants threatens to overturn the significant progress made so far in limiting the spread of this viral illness. This review article aims to comprehensively describe the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and the latest novel therapeutics in the management of {COVID}-19. This review also briefly provides an overview of the different variants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and the efficacy of different available vaccines for prevention against {COVID}-19 and its variants.},

	abstract = {While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) was initially thought to enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane, more recent evidence suggests that virus entry may also involve endocytosis. We have found that {SARS}-{CoV} enters cells via {pH}- and receptor-dependent endocytosis. Treatment of cells with either {SARS}-{CoV} spike protein or spike-bearing pseudoviruses resulted in the translocation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE}2), the functional receptor of {SARS}-{CoV}, from the cell surface to endosomes. In addition, the spike-bearing pseudoviruses and early endosome antigen 1 were found to colocalize in endosomes. Further analyses using specific endocytic pathway inhibitors and dominant-negative Eps15 as well as caveolin-1 colocalization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism. Moreover, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways, were shown to be involved in virus entry. Endocytic entry of {SARS}-{CoV} may expand the cellular range of {SARS}-{CoV} infection, and our findings here contribute to the understanding of {SARS}-{CoV} pathogenesis, providing new information for anti-viral drug research.},

	title = {Antibody-drug conjugates as novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics},
	volume = {35},
	doi = {10.1042/BSR20150089},
	abstract = {Over the past couple of decades, antibody-drug conjugates ({ADCs}) have revolutionized the field of cancer chemotherapy. Unlike conventional treatments that damage healthy tissues upon dose escalation, {ADCs} utilize monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) to specifically bind tumour-associated target antigens and deliver a highly potent cytotoxic agent. The synergistic combination of {mAbs} conjugated to small-molecule chemotherapeutics, via a stable linker, has given rise to an extremely efficacious class of anti-cancer drugs with an already large and rapidly growing clinical pipeline. The primary objective of this paper is to review current knowledge and latest developments in the field of {ADCs}. Upon intravenous administration, {ADCs} bind to their target antigens and are internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This facilitates the subsequent release of the cytotoxin, which eventually leads to apoptotic cell death of the cancer cell. The three components of {ADCs} ({mAb}, linker and cytotoxin) affect the efficacy and toxicity of the conjugate. Optimizing each one, while enhancing the functionality of the {ADC} as a whole, has been one of the major considerations of {ADC} design and development. In addition to these, the choice of clinically relevant targets and the position and number of linkages have also been the key determinants of {ADC} efficacy. The only marketed {ADCs}, brentuximab vedotin and trastuzumab emtansine (T-{DM}1), have demonstrated their use against both haematological and solid malignancies respectively. The success of future {ADCs} relies on improving target selection, increasing cytotoxin potency, developing innovative linkers and overcoming drug resistance. As more research is conducted to tackle these issues, {ADCs} are likely to become part of the future of targeted cancer therapeutics.

This activity was said to ‘complement’ the antibacterial activity of antibody, hence the name.

Indeed, it now seems clear that complement first evolved as part of the innate immune system, where it still plays an important role.},

	abstract = {The complement membrane attack complex ({MAC}) is classically known as a cytolytic effector of innate and adaptive immunity that forms pores in the plasma membrane of pathogens or targeted cells, leading to osmolysis. Nucleated cells resist {MAC}-mediated cytolysis by expression of inhibitors that block {MAC} assembly or by rapid removal of {MAC} through endocytosis or shedding. In the absence of lysis, {MAC} may induce intracellular signaling and cell activation, responses implicated in a variety of autoimmune, inflammatory, and transplant disease settings. New discoveries into the structure and biophysical properties of {MAC} revealed heterogeneous {MAC} precursors and conformations that provide insights into {MAC} function. In addition, new mechanisms of {MAC}-mediated signaling and its contribution to disease pathogenesis have recently come to light. {MAC}-activated cells have been found to express proinflammatory proteins—often through {NF}-κB–dependent transcription, assemble inflammasomes, enabling processing, and facilitate secretion of {IL}-1β and {IL}-18, as well as other signaling pathways. These recent insights into the mechanisms of action of {MAC} provide an updated framework to therapeutic approaches that can target {MAC} assembly, signaling, and proinflammatory effects in various complement-mediated diseases.},

They can be separated functionally into variable domains that bind antigens and constant domains that specify effector functions, such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors. The variable domains are created by means of a complex series of gene rearrangement events and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutation after exposure to antigen to allow affinity maturation. Each variable domain can be split into 3 regions of sequence variability termed the complementarity-determining regions ({CDRs}) and 4 regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions. The 3 {CDRs} of the heavy chain are paired with the 3 {CDRs} of the light chain to form the antigen-binding site, as classically defined. The constant domains of the heavy chain can be switched to allow altered effector function while maintaining antigen specificity. There are 5 main classes of heavy chain constant domains. Each class defines the {IgM}, {IgG}, {IgA}, {IgD}, and {IgE} isotypes. {IgG} can be split into 4 subclasses, {IgG}1, {IgG}2, {IgG}3, and {IgG}4, each with its own biologic properties, and {IgA} can similarly be split into {IgA}1 and {IgA}2.},

	abstract = {B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The fact that humans express a very large repertoire of antibodies is due to the complex mechanism of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes as well as other processes including somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switching. The B cell receptor ({BCR}) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two Ig heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Igalpha and Igbeta. To eliminate foreign antigens, B cells cooperate with other cells of the immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. B cell development is a tightly controlled process in which over 75\% of the developing cells become apoptotic because of inappropriate immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or recognition of self antigens by Igs. Hence, the majority of B cell-associated disorders are caused by the incorrect function of genes/proteins involved in B cell development.},

	abstract = {Seventy percent of peripheral immature conventional (B2) B cells
 fail to develop into mature B cells. The nature of this cell loss has
 not been characterized; the process that governs which immature B cells
 develop into long-lived peripheral B cells could be either stochastic
 or selective. Here, we demonstrate that this step is in fact selective,
 in that the fate of an immature B cell is highly dependent on its Ig
 receptor specificity. A significant skewing of the B cell receptor
 repertoire occurs by the time cells enter the mature B cell fraction,
 which indicates that there is selection of only a minority of immature
 B cells to become mature B cells. Because only a few heavy-light chain
 pairs are enhanced of the diverse available repertoire, we favor the
 idea that selection is positive for these few heavy-light chain pairs
 rather than negative against nearly all others. Because most immature B
 cells are lost at this transition, this putative positive selection
 event is likely to be a major force shaping the mature B cell receptor
 repertoire available for adaptive immune responses.},

	abstract = {The B-cell antigen receptor ({BCR}) plays a central role in the clonal selection of B cells and the generation of humoral immunity. In addition from inducing a specific immune response, the expression of the {BCR} also is required for the proper development and maintenance of the B-cell pool in the periphery. Each mature B cell carries roughly 120,000 {BCR} complexes on the cell surface with identical antigen binding sites. Because of the highly variable immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement program, B cells differ from each other in the antigen-binding specificity of their {BCR}. It has been estimated that most of the 1011 B cells of the human immune system differ from each other in their exact binding specificity. The enormous binding variability of their antigen receptors are characteristic of both B and T cells. However, unlike T cells, whose antigen receptors are restricted in binding to a defined antigen structure, namely the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC})/peptide complex, B cells can be activated by a large group of structurally highly diverse molecules. In this respect, the {BCR} is quite different from most other receptors on the cell surface that have only one or a few specific ligands. Any model of B-cell activation should take into account these unique properties of the {BCR}. In this chapter we describe the basic structure of the {BCR} and several proposed models for its activation. We also discuss the interaction of the {BCR} with signal-transducing kinases, with a focus on the Src-family kinase Lyn and the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). We then address the structure and function of the B-cell coreceptors that either amplify ({CD}19) or inhibit ({CD}22) {BCR} signaling. Once B cells are activated, signals from {BCR} are processed through several signaling pathways. In our discussion of these processes, we focus on the phospholipase ({PL}) C-γ2 calcium release machinery and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) signaling pathway controlling proliferation and survival of B cells. Together, these pathways drive the clonal expansion of B cells and their differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells.},
