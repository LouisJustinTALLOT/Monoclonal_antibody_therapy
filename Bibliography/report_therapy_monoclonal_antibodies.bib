	abstract = {Monoclonal antibody therapeutics have been approved for over 30 targets and diseases, most commonly cancer. Antibodies have become the new backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, which previously relied on small molecules. Compared with small molecules, monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) have exquisite target selectivity and hence less toxicity as a result of binding other targets. The clinical value of both {mAbs} and ligand traps has been proven. New applications of {mAbs} are being tested and {mAbs} have now been designed to target two (bi-specific, eg {TNF}-α and {IL}-17) or more targets simultaneously, augmenting their therapeutic potential. Because of space limitations and the wide ranging scope of this review there are regrettably, but inevitably, omissions and missing citations. We have chosen to highlight the first successes in inflammatory diseases and cancer, but a broader overview of approved {mAbs} and related molecules can be found in Table 1.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for many molecular immunology investigations. In particular, when used in combination with techniques such as epitope mapping and molecular modelling, monoclonal antibodies enable the antigenic profiling and visualisation of macromolecular surfaces. In addition, monoclonal antibodies have become key components in a vast array of clinical laboratory diagnostic tests. Their wide application in detecting and identifying serum analytes, cell markers, and pathogenic agents has largely arisen through the exquisite specificity of these unique reagents. Furthermore, the continuous culture of hybridoma cells that produce these antibodies offers the potential of an unlimited supply of reagent. In essence, when compared with the rather limited supply of polyclonal antibody reagents, the feature of a continuous supply enables the standardisation of both the reagent and the assay technique. Clearly, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of generation, cost, and overall applications. Ultimately, monoclonal antibodies are only produced when necessary because their production is time consuming and frustrating, although greatly rewarding (at least most of the time!). This is especially apparent when a monoclonal antibody can be applied successfully in a routine pathology laboratory or can aid in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. In this article, the generation and application of monoclonal antibodies are demystified to enable greater understanding and hopefully formulate novel ideas for clinicians and scientists alike.},

	doi = {10.1038/leu.2016.226},
	abstract = {A key feature of the adaptive immune system is the generation of memory B and T cells and long-lived plasma cells, providing protective immunity against recurring infectious agents. Memory B cells are generated in germinal center ({GC}) reactions in the course of T cell-dependent immune responses and are distinguished from naive B cells by an increased lifespan, faster and stronger response to stimulation and expression of somatically mutated and affinity matured immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Approximately 40\% of human B cells in adults are memory B cells, and several subsets were identified. Besides {IgG}+ and {IgA}+ memory B cells, ∼50\% of peripheral blood memory B cells express {IgM} with or without {IgD}. Further smaller subpopulations have additionally been described. These various subsets share typical memory B cell features, but likely also fulfill distinct functions. {IgM} memory B cells appear to have the propensity for refined adaptation upon restimulation in additional {GC} reactions, whereas reactivated {IgG} B cells rather differentiate directly into plasma cells. The human memory B-cell pool is characterized by (sometimes amazingly large) clonal expansions, often showing extensive intraclonal {IgV} gene diversity. Moreover, memory B-cell clones are frequently composed of members of various subsets, showing that from a single {GC} B-cell clone a variety of memory B cells with distinct functions is generated. Thus, the human memory B-cell compartment is highly diverse and flexible. Several B-cell malignancies display features suggesting a derivation from memory B cells. This includes a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and marginal zone lymphomas. The exposure of memory B cells to oncogenic events during their generation in the {GC}, the longevity of these B cells and the ease to activate them may be key determinants for their malignant transformation.},

Monoclonal antibody therapy harnesses host defense mechanisms through activation of the antibody dependent cytotoxic pathway and complement mediated cytotoxicity. However, these two processes alone do not explain the therapeutic efficacy of antibody therapy; they also act by apoptotic signaling and growth inhibitory pathways. Conjugation of monoclonal antibody therapy, with radionuclides or toxins, offers more therapeutic approaches. Initial data demonstrates efficacy of single agent use, although combination therapy appears potentially more beneficial. Monoclonal antibody therapy is having a significant impact on many disease processes, particularly malignancies of solid and hematological origin.

Antibody production requires a substantial number of animals, and the animals are subjected to a number of invasive procedures such as antigen injection and blood collection. However, by carefully designing an immunization protocol and by optimizing the immunization response, it is possible to minimize animals' pain and distress while obtaining optimal immune responses. In this article, the critical steps in the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are described, specifically including selection of the animal species and its age, injection protocol, and ascites tapping.

Licensed products are available for inhibition of alloimmune and autoimmune reactivity, and for antitumour, antiplatelet, or antiviral therapy. Short-term side-effects are tolerable and as expected, although long-term safety remains to be elucidated. The cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life benefits of the use of {mAb} in patients who are usually seriously and chronically ill also needs studying.

No difference was observed between the values obtained for Lesch-Nyhan and control lymphocytes, when {PHA}-stimulated without added azaserine. The percentage reduction in the incorporation of precursors into nucleoprotein and protein after {PHA} stimulation in the presence of azaserine was more obvious in the lymphocytes of the patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome than in the controls after the shorter incubation periods at the lower rates of synthesis. Blocking the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, in control {PHA} stimulated lymphocytes, inhibited transformation, whereas loss of the purine salvage enzyme {HGPRT} did not have this effect. These results are compatible with the view that the brain and bone-marrow damage that occur in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are the result of lack of {HGPRT} in tissues with little de novo purine biosynthetic capability. Other tissues with both pruine biosynthetic and salvage pathways are less vulnerable to the enzyme defect. Some possible mechanisms by which {HGPRT} deficiency could act are discussed. We suggest that inability to increase the supply of guanylic acid ({GMP}) in response to a mitotic stimulus may mediate the effect of {HGPRT} deficiency.},

Several parameters influencing sensitivity and specificity were studied. About 150 ng/ml of mouse monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens could be detected when using 5 x 10(4) cells per well and a 1/1000 dilution of the anti-mouse {IgG}-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. This sensitivity permitted the primary screening of cell specific antibodies from hybridoma supernatants. The same detection limit was obtained in flow cytometric analysis. If required, the sensitivity of the cell {ELISA} could be increased using higher cell numbers and conjugate concentration. When analysing different cell lines with selected antibodies the cell {ELISA} was found to be as sensitive and specific as the fluorescence assay.
